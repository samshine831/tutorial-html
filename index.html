    <p> George Lucas thought that the scene between <strong>Han Solo</strong> and Greedo, in the Canteena, made Han look cold blooded. Let's think of the original scene, shall we? Greedo the bounty hunteris holding Han at gunpoint and says (in his gurgly voice) he is going to kill him. Han shoots Greedo through the table before Greedo can blow Han a new smuggling hatch. That makes Han <em>cool</em>, not cold.</p>
